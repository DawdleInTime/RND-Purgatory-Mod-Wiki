(Retake on the slothy one's sprite)

# Appearances
__Slothy One__ has two forms, his mimicked forms and his true form.

Note that the slothy one clones A[20], A[190] and A[200].
- However you may see his true normal form on a locker, He'll then scare u out of the locker and damage you.

His mimicked forms consist of blue colored entities without sound.
- Meanwhile his true form looks like a gray decomposed body without eyes and a big mouth.

# Mechanics
__Slothy One__'s mimicked form will make absolutely no noise, and flicker a player's flashlight after the original entity attack.

__Slothy One__'s true form will appear on a locker heavily breathing, If someone tries to enter the locker he is in, they will get kicked out of it and damaged.

# Trivia
__Slothy One__ is actually the primes from rooms & doors and shell.
- And because you can't remove entities, They had to be added in as a actual part of the mod.
