(Retake on Devils Sprite)

### Appearance
__Bloodshed__ looks like a red-like hand with basic large teeth
- Meanwhile his minions have no teeth, but they are still hands.

### Mechanics
__Bloodshed__ will rumble through the ceiling, You must hide below a table.
- And his minions will come from the back, so dont fall behind!

__Bloodshed__ digs holes in the rooms.

### Trivia
__Bloodshed__ is a combination of Kalypto (R&D) and the Void (R&D).

__Bloodshed__ is the first entity to appear.
