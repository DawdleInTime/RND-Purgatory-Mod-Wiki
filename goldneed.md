(Goldneed's Ingame Sprite)

# Appearance
Goldneed seems to be a happy face with large teeth, having wide eyes and ripped gold face parts.

He also has a static-like look and will always smile, Even in it's jumpscare sequence.

# Mechanics
He behaves like ![The Envied One](https://github.com/DawdleInTime/RND-Purgatory-Mod-Wiki/blob/main/envied_one.md) but he will rebound slowly, Looking for gold and not wanting to cause harm.
- Despite that, He thinks the player is gold due to his yellow blurry vision. And will try to catch the Player to eat gold.

He will also wander through rooms making a silent sound, Pay attention whenever you hear a gurling noise, Because it is him.
- Before version 107, ![The Envied One](https://github.com/DawdleInTime/RND-Purgatory-Mod-Wiki/blob/main/envied_one.md) would make burgling noises instead.

# Trivia

Before version 106, It used to be more based on wrath than greed, He later switched roles with ![Wrath Outsidæ](https://github.com/DawdleInTime/RND-Purgatory-Mod-Wiki/blob/main/wrathoutsidae.md)

![Desired Skull](https://github.com/DawdleInTime/RND-Purgatory-Mod-Wiki/blob/main/desiredskull.md) can stop __Goldneed__'s sound.

He used to have no sound before version 106, And have a windy noise before version 107.
- ![The Envied One](https://github.com/DawdleInTime/RND-Purgatory-Mod-Wiki/blob/main/envied_one.md) later took his windy sound in version 107+
