(An view of the Lunarlight)

# Mechanic
It is an light source like the __Ocean Flashlight__, But it can be shaked to recharge instead of using batteries.

It doesnt waste stamina even tho you must shake it to recharge.
- However shaking it on tight spaces (Tables/Lockers) may decrease stamina

It also produces a very loud banging sound that sounds like a metal pipe.

# Trivia

The Lunarlight's Sound when shaking it is from a metal pipe falling meme.
- At first noticed, It will probably make players laugh.

The Lunarlight is considered the second hard lightsource to see with before rooms A-50+
- This may also apply to the Ocean Flashlight, As it is more dim than Lunarlight.
