# Appearance
__Selfisj__ is a red eye with black pupil that is omnipresent but likes to attack ones in lockers.

__Selfish__ looks like a normal eye, since it's true form hasn't been revealed yet.

# Mechanics
It will attack players who hide in lockers, because it wants to see the player's "uglyness"
- It is so much pride that the anomaly believes others look like trash, not a offense btw.

__Sefish__ will then slowly crush the locker further into making the Player look more pale like a mannequin, and get stuck in a corroted locker.

# Trivia

__Selfisj__ has no change to it's R&D counterpart.
- Only difference is the name of it.

Selfish attacking a Player.
