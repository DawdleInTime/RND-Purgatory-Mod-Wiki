# Appearance
__The Envied One__ is a giant green eyeball with green tears falling and a (rarely seen) green-like aura, He has a vision breaking effect to the naked eye of a human.

He is also described as the main antagonist of the purgatory, As he is the first to be met by the player (Unless you count Satanás, Considered to be the creator of the Purgatory).

# Mechanics
__The Envied One__ will appear back in room A-001 and will speed all the way to find the Player and emit deadly radiation that feels like acid.

Meanwhile he dashes through the rooms, He will make windy sounds and whisper sometimes to the Player's ear.

# Trivia
__The Envied One__ used to have no appearance until Version 103, Where he got an early more corrupted look. And until Version 106 (Current Sprite)

__The Envied One__ can be mimicked by ![Slothy One](https://github.com/DawdleInTime/RND-Purgatory-Mod-Wiki/blob/main/slothyone.md)
- Althought the clone becomes more blue to resemble it's creator and makes more visual effects.

__The Envied One__ used to make a burgling noise before Version 107, But many Players found it dificult to listen to.
- Now, ![Goldneed](https://github.com/DawdleInTime/RND-Purgatory-Mod-Wiki/blob/main/goldneed.md) uses it's audio.
