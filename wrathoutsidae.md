(Wrath Outsidæ's Sprite)

# Appearance
__Wrath Outsidæ__ is a corroted red-ish angry laughing face with bloodshed eyes and a mouth halfway glued.

He's depicted as an anomaly that is always angry, although he is raging inside, he makes no sound while attacking.

# Mechanics

__Wrath Outsidæ__ completely steals ![Goldneed](https://github.com/DawdleInTime/RND-Purgatory-Mod-Wiki/blob/main/goldneed.md)'s strategy but moves way silenter.
- He will also completely enrage the player in the moment it catches up into its mind, making the player scream in pain into death.

__Wrath Outsidæ__ can alter the player's emotions, but it will change your vision meanwhile his attack.

# Trivia

__The Envied One__ used to be part of __Wrath Outsidæ__'s ripped eye before V107+

__Wrath Outsidæ__ is considered the hardest entity in the mod.

__Wrath Outsidæ__ used to appear at A-120, before it was later changed.
- ![Goldneed](https://github.com/DawdleInTime/RND-Purgatory-Mod-Wiki/blob/main/goldneed.md) now appears at A-120 instead.
